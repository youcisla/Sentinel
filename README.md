# Proposal: Project "Sentinel" – Turning 57 Years of Experience into a Digital Asset

**Subject:** Strategy to eliminate "Key Person Risk" and institutionalize 50+ years of team intuition.

---

## 1. The Executive Summary

Currently, our team holds a combined **57 years of specialized experience**. This is our most valuable asset, yet it is currently **analog and siloed**. When a senior team member is in a meeting, we benefit; when they are absent or leave the company, that "intuition" is lost.

Project **Sentinel** is a proposal to build a **Team Intuition Engine**. Unlike a traditional database or "Wiki" (which are reactive and often ignored), Sentinel is a proactive system that uses AI agents to simulate the collective "gut feelings" and historical lessons of our entire team to vet new projects and prevent costly repeats of past mistakes.

## 2. The Problem: The "Invisible Knowledge Tax"

Every organization pays an "Invisible Tax" in two ways:

1. **Redundant Failure:** Spending budget/time on a path a senior member already knows is a dead end, simply because they weren't in the room during the planning phase.
2. **Asset Depreciation:** When an expert leaves, their 10–20 years of "intuition"—the ability to spot red flags before they happen—walks out the door with them.

## 3. The Solution: The "Synthetic Council"

We will move beyond "Knowledge Management" and into **"Experience Synthesis."** Using **n8n** (automation orchestration) and **Private Agentic AI**, we will build a system that does three things:

### A. Passive Intuition Capture

We won't ask the team to "write manuals." Instead, the system uses n8n to "listen" to existing workflows:

* **Post-Mortems:** Transcribing 2-minute voice notes on "What felt wrong" during a project.
* **Decision Logs:** Capturing the *why* behind a choice, not just the *what*.
* **The Anti-Library:** Storing "Red Flags" and failed experiments that usually never make it into formal documentation.

### B. Proactive Risk Simulation (The "Digital Ghost")

When a new project is proposed in Jira/Notion, the system doesn't wait for a search query. It automatically triggers a **Synthetic Council**:

* AI agents—modeled on the specific historical decision-making patterns of our senior staff—review the proposal.
* The system generates a **"Pre-Mortem Report"**: *"Based on Marc’s 2022 project and Sarah’s 2019 vendor failure, this plan has a high risk of bottlenecking at Stage 2."*

### C. The "Shadow Mentor"

Junior staff can "query the team's soul" in Slack. Instead of finding a document, they get a synthesized answer: *"The team's collective experience suggests that while Plan A is standard, we usually choose Plan B in this specific context because of [Past Reason X]."*

## 4. Why This is Different

| Feature | Traditional Wiki/Notion | Project Sentinel (AI + n8n) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Engagement** | Reactive (You must look for it) | **Proactive** (It finds you) |
| **Content** | Static Data (Facts) | **Intuition** (Context/Gut Feelings) |
| **Maintenance** | High (Human updates) | **Low** (Automated capture via n8n) |
| **Result** | A library of files | **A simulation of expertise** |

## 5. Business Value & ROI

* **Risk Mitigation:** Prevents one $50k+ mistake by flagging a "known failure" early in the planning cycle.
* **Onboarding Velocity:** Reduces the "time-to-autonomy" for new hires by giving them an AI "Senior Mentor" trained on our specific history.
* **Intellectual Property Retention:** Converts human experience into a permanent digital company asset. Even if the team changes, the *wisdom* remains.

## 6. Implementation Roadmap (Low-Risk Pilot)

I propose a **30-day "Proof of Concept"** with zero disruption to current workflows:

1. **Days 1-10:** Use n8n to ingest the last 2 years of project "Retrospectives" into a private, secure Vector Database.
2. **Days 11-20:** Create a "Synthetic Persona" based on our most senior technical/operational logic.
3. **Days 21-30:** Run three "Pre-Mortem" simulations on upcoming projects and compare the AI’s "concerns" with the actual concerns of our senior leads.
